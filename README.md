Welcome to Where Are We Going?, a full-stack e-commerce website built using the Django framework, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Python & JavaScript.  It uses Stripe as the payment processor and Amazon Web Services S3 Bucket to store static and media files. The project has been deployed on Heroku and uses a PostgreSQL database instance hosted on ElephantSQL.

This project was created for educational purposes as my fifth and final project for a Diploma in Software Development with Code Institute. Where are we going? is an online shop where the user can buy tickets for the best festivals in the world.

## Introduction
I have come up with an idea to address the growing issue of festival-goers feeling overwhelmed when selecting a festival to attend. With the increasing number of festivals available, people often struggle to determine which event would be the best fit for them. To tackle this problem, I propose the creation of an online platform that serves as a comprehensive hub for the finest festivals worldwide. This platform will simplify the process for users by offering a curated selection of top-tier festivals and facilitating ticket purchases. By centralizing information and ticket sales, attendees can make more informed decisions about their festival choices, enhancing their overall experience.

By following the principles of User Experience Design, Search Engine Optimization and utilizing the Django full-stack framework and Stripe API for secure payments, Where Are We Going? offers its customers an efficient and seamless way to view and purchase its products from anywhere in the world.

You can test the payment functionality by using the following details on the checkout page:

-   Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
-   Expiry Date: Any future date formatted to MM/YY
-   CVN: Any 3-digit number

## Business Model
"Where Are We Going?" is a business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce platform curated for festival enthusiasts. Our platform provides an online marketplace dedicated to procuring tickets for the world's premier festivals, ensuring that users are exclusively presented with the finest events. Users have the option to maintain a connection with us through email or WhatsApp Business, allowing them to offer comments, seek assistance, or share suggestions seamlessly.

### Marketing Strategy
The marketing strategy should focus on establishing the brand as a symbol of transparency, safety, reliability, and the ultimate destination for top-quality festival purchases. Achieving this requires developing a comprehensive content plan tailored to various social networks, as well as implementing a strategic search engine optimization (SEO) approach to secure a prominent position among the top search results. Additionally, it is essential to incorporate a newsletter system to nurture a loyal user base.

The primary objective is to enhance the conversion rate by bridging the gap between site visitors and those who ultimately decide to purchase tickets. This can be achieved by increasing the influx of users to the platform and seamlessly guiding them towards the decision to secure their tickets.

#### Social Media Marketing
To enhance the e-commerce presence, a Facebook page was established to facilitate direct communication between the administrator and the audience. This platform serves as a means to cultivate a follower base by engaging with other accounts, posts, comments, videos, and advertisements. Below, you'll find a screenshot of the business's Facebook page and its inaugural post. Regrettably, a short while later, Facebook unexpectedly shut down the page.

</details>

#### Email Marketing
An email newsletter subscription service will be implemented on the e-commerce website. This service will keep users informed about the latest news, special promotions, and more, while also motivating them to revisit the website.

Displayed below are screenshots of the newsletter subscription form and the inaugural user who has successfully registered.

### Search Engine Optimisation
Search engine optimisation (SEO) encompasses a number of techniques aimed at improving the visibility and ranking of web pages in organic search results. In my efforts to increase my website's search engine ranking, I researched keywords.

To do this, I used [Word Tracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/) to select the most relevant keywords. Once the optimal keywords were identified, I strategically integrated them into various elements of the website, such as meta tags, content and alternative image descriptions. This extensive keyword integration helps search engines understand the interconnectedness between the various pages of the website and ultimately improves its visibility in search engines.

Furthermore, I've incorporated a sitemap.xml and a robots.txt file into my project. The sitemap offers a comprehensive list of all website pages, ensuring search engines can efficiently navigate through the content. In parallel, the robots.txt file provides instructions to search engines, outlining which specific pages should not be crawled or indexed. Below are screenshots from both files:

<details>
<summary>SEO Files</summary>

    sitemap.xml
![sitemap.xml](https://github.com/BohdanBezushka/wherearewegoing/assets/94321555/3060c2d4-273f-4638-ae93-2f64e901b516)

    robots.txt

</details>

Moreover, each festival name is equipped with a link that, when clicked, opens in a new tab, directing users to the official festival website. This strategic linking fosters a connection between our website and the festivals, contributing to an improved ranking within search engine results.

Additionally, a privacy policy has been seamlessly integrated into the website. Although not a direct SEO ranking determinant, including this policy is advised for search engines like Google to index. Furthermore, it significantly enhances the website's credibility and trustworthiness. This step aligns with compliance efforts related to diverse data protection and privacy laws and regulations.

### Website Main Goals

### Data Models
Models define the source of the data stored.  Each model contains the essential fields and behaviours of the data being stored. The image below shows this project's Data Schema and the relationships between the models.

<details>
<summary>Database Schema</summary>

![Database Schema](https://github.com/BohdanBezushka/wherearewegoing/assets/94321555/acfa6844-454f-426e-9774-3549a8940b05)

</details>

### Design

**Colour Scheme**
![Coolors]( https://coolors.co/) was used to generate a colour palette for the website:

![colour-scheme](https://github.com/BohdanBezushka/wherearewegoing/assets/94321555/96547f1c-e4a5-4194-8297-a2ac8b8b5870)

* The colour `000000` is used to give it a plain background so that the user can clearly distinguish the content.
* The colour `FF0000` is mainly used on the buttons when the user stops the mouse over them.
* The colour `FF66B2` is mainly used on the footer buttons to differentiate them from the others.

**Typography**
The typography used throughout the project is ['Geologica'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Geologica?query=GEOLOGICA) because it is a versatile typeface that works well for both display and body text. Different weights and styles of 'Geologica' are used in the project to distinguish more important parts from others or to highlight specific text.

![Google Fonts](https://github.com/BohdanBezushka/wherearewegoing/assets/94321555/479a3dc1-3ee2-4e73-adff-c5e01c2ef6d7)

**Icons**
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) social media icons were used for the Footer. They are used as interactive links and have an aria-label which gives the relevant information to screen readers to read out to the users. 

**Wireframes**
Wireframes are made in Canva. Below you can see the design of the different parts of the project. But I have not been able to develop the project as I wanted due to lack of time because I am working in a company since June and I have practically no time to dedicate to the project. That's why you can see that the final design of my project doesn't look like the wireframes.

## Agile Methodology
The plan for this project was carried out using the Agile Methodology. GitHub issues, which can be found [here](https://github.com/BohdanBezushka/wherearewegoing/issues), were used to record user stories, bugs and developer tasks. These were categorised into 4 Epics/Milestones and organised into 1 Project/Sprint. Each User Story includes Acceptance Criteria and Tasks that are necessary for a clear and effective approach to the project, ensuring that the minimum project requirements are met. The MoSCoW Method of Prioritisation was also used, classifying each User Story as a "Must Have", "Should Have", "Could Have" and "Won't have". Also, the labels "Fix bug" and "Project Task" were added for better organisation.

"USER HISTORY: Different ways to create an account" and "USER STORY: Tickets by email" I have not been able to implement them due to lack of time.

## Future Features
When I have time, I would like to continue working on the following features:

* Implement a ticket delivery (with a unique code to avoid scams) to the user's email address and phone number when the user completes the purchase.
* Implement a blog in order to attract more users to the website.
* I would like to add the option for users to register using Google or Facebook because it makes accessing the application faster. The registration process will be implemented using Django Allauth to integrate with the authentication APIs of these platforms.

## Bugs
**üêõ**
<details>
<summary>Festivals weren't loaded:</summary>
  
Problem: When I passed all the data to ElephantSQL and had to load all the festivals I got the following error:
![problem1](https://github.com/BohdanBezushka/wherearewegoing/assets/94321555/c06f30f2-b53d-4d1a-8042-18a25270e6db)

Solution: Create a JSON file for uploading festivals.

<summary>Heroku login in Terminal:</summary>

Problem: When I logged into Heroku through the terminal I got the following error:
![problem2](https://github.com/BohdanBezushka/wherearewegoing/assets/94321555/46e4a988-405e-4cae-9c5b-239621935959)

Solution: The error is due to the fact that in my Heroku account, I have Multi-Factor Authentication enabled. So I have to use the command "heroku login -i" put my email and when it asks for the password, enter the API Key.

**üêõüêõüêõ**
<details>
<summary>It does not send email confirmation messages when a user registers:</summary>

Problem: When a new user registers on the website, the page keeps refreshing constantly until it displays the following error:
![problem3](https://github.com/BohdanBezushka/wherearewegoing/assets/94321555/3c24caa0-8b46-4d16-b092-8bb434b9b8b7)

Solution: The solution is to add again a new application with a password through Google security settings and modify in Heroku settings in your project the EMAIL_HOST_PASS.
